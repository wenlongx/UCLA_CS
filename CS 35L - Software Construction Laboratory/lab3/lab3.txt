First, I downloaded the tar ball:
    wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutiles-7.6.tar.gz > 
coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
Then I used the command
    tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to unzip the file into the folder coreutils-7.6/
    cd coreutils-7.6/

I then ran the following commands to install coreutils-7.6. The path 
/home/wenlong/Desktop/lab3 is the path to the temporary directory that the 
coreutils is being installed on:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/wenlong/Desktop/lab3
    make
    make install
I then ran the following command to generate the locale
    locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
Then, I ran the ls command:
    ls -l /bin/bash
Which yielded the following line of output
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1021112 2014-10-07 12:22 /bin/bash
This is the YYYY-MM-DD date format instead of the traditional Unix date format

To fix this bug, I modified the file src/ls.c
    vim src/ls.c
I removed line 2014:
    case_long_iso_time_style:
And removed lines 2031-2038 inclusive. I replaced them with the lines
                    long_time_format[i] = dcgettext (NULL, long_time_format[i], 
LC_TIME);
Then I ran the command to rebuild the file
    make
Then I ran the ls command
    touch a.txt
    touch -t 200402291621.42 b.txt //this changes the modified time to 2004, 
Feb 29, 16:21:42
and ran the ls command on both of them to make sure it works:
    ls -l
which output the following:  
    -rw-r--r--   1 wenlongx  wenlong     0 Oct 16 01:27 a.txt
    -rw-r--r--   1 wenlongx  wenlong     0 Feb 29  2004 b.txt
    drwxr-xr-x  65 wenlongx  wenlong  2210 Oct 16 00:14 coreutils-7.6
