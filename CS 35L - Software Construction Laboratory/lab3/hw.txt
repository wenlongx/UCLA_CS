Q1:
Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because the only 
line that referenced 
that tag (the line goto case_long_iso_time_style;) was removed as well. The 
code will work even 
without removing the line "case_long_iso_time_style:", because the jump to that 
line that was in 
case locale_time_style was removed.
Q2:
The patch removes the fallback to the long_iso_time_style format. However, the 
function dcgettext 
is a translation function, so there should not be a problem when the code is 
used in non-English 
speaking countries.


Q3:
In line 13:
    return random.choice(self.lines)
The program returns the following error:
    IndexError: list index out of range
This is because the an empty file is a null array, and when we try to access a 
specific index in 
the null array, we get an IndexError.

Q4:
When the script is run with python 3 instead of python 2, we get the following 
error:
  File "randline.py", line 44
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This is because in python 2.7, exceptions could be passed in as iterables. 
However, in python 3.4, 
the syntax was changed to not allow this, because it was bad practice.
