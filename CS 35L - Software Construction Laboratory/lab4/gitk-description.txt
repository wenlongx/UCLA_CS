The top left window is a visual of the commit tree - with each branch and 
commits labeled. Top middle window shows who submitted the commit, and the top 
right window shows the timestamp at which the commit was submitted. In the 
middle, there is a search bar, which lets you search the commit for a specific 
string. In the bottom right, there is an option to show "patch" or "tree". 
"patch" shows you the all the files that were modified in the commit, and 
selecting one of them from the "patch" window shows the diff (patch) file in 
the bottom left window. You also have the option to select "Comments", which 
shows the header for the diff file. "tree" lets you see all the files in the 
git repository, and lets you select any one of them to view (even if the file 
was not modified in the commit). Selecting one of the files causes the source 
code to display in the bottom left window.
