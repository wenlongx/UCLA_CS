I used the command
    git checkout -b quote
    patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
to patch the v3.0 version of diff. I then opened all 6 modified files in emacs, 
and wrote a Changelog message for each of them:
    emacs FILENAME
    C-x 4 a
    (typed in changelog message)
    C-x C-c
This resulted in a file called ChangeLog in the directory src/. I then 
committed the changes:
    git add .
    git commit -a -F src/ChangeLog
I then used the following command to find the commit hash:
    git log
And the following command to create the file formatted-patch.txt:
    git format-patch -1 <sha> > formatted-patch.txt
where <sha> is the commit hash. I then sent the file to my partner Michael 
Xiong (minghai@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu)
    scp xiong@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:~/formatted-patch.txt 
minghai@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:~/lab4
And he sent his over as well. I then applied the patch using the command:
    git am formatted-patch.txt
And I got the following message:
    Applying: 2015-10-24 Michael Minghai Xiong <minghai@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>
I then built the resulting files
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make distdir
And I found the entry in the diffutils-3.0.2-3b86c/ChangeLog
