First, I logged onto the linux server with the following command:
    ssh xiong@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
Then, I checked that the coreutils sort was the correct version (>8.6) with the following command:
    sort --version
I got the following output, so the version of sort is up to date:
    sort (GNU coreutils) 8.24

Afterwards, I ran the following command:
    od -An -f -N 4000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > numbers.txt
This created the file of floats. I then opened the file in vim and deleted the first line, which 
was a blank line (newline).
    vim numbers.txt
Afterwards, I ran the sort command on the numbers.txt file, with different number of threads.
    time -p sort -g --parallel=1 numbers.txt > /dev/null
    time -p sort -g --parallel=2 numbers.txt > /dev/null
    time -p sort -g --parallel=4 numbers.txt > /dev/null
    time -p sort -g --parallel=8 numbers.txt > /dev/null
This yielded the following times:
