CS35L Section 3


I SSH'ed into the Linux SEAS server with the following command and entered my pa
ssword
	ssh xiong@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

First I checked to see I was using the standard C locale by entering the command
    locale
I was not, so I input the following command
    export LC_ALL = 'C'
which changed my locale

I figured out how to use the sort command by entering the following command
    man sort
and then sorted the contents of the file /usr/share/dict/words into my current d
irectory with the command
    sort /usr/share/dict/words > words

    tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
The command echoes the input file, but replaces every non alphabetical character
 (non A-Z or a-z) with the newline character

    tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
The command does the same as the previous command, but compresses multiple conse
cutive instances of the characters listed in the last operand (\n) into a single
 instance. Basically, this command trimes multiple consecutive newlines into a s
ingle one.

    tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
The command pipes the output of tr into sort, and sorts each line by their ASCII
 values

    tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
The command sorts each line by their ASCII values, like the previous command, bu
t also only outputs unique values - so we have a list of unique words

    tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
The command compares the sorted list of words with our dictionary, and outputs 3
 columns. The first column are lines that only exist in our html file, the secon
d column is lines that only exist in our 'words' dictionary, and the 3rd column
consists of lines that exist in both.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
The command does the same as the previous one, but surpresses the 2nd and 3rd co
lumns, so that we have a list of lines that are unique to our html file.


Creating hwords

I first pulled out all the words between the tags: <tr> <td>Eword</td> <td>Hword
</td>, and put them in a file called hwords. I used .+ instead of .*, so that th
e empty <td></td> tags weren't included in the search.
    egrep '<td>.+</td>' hawaii.html
I then translated all the uppercase letters to lowercase with tr
    tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
I also converted all instances of ` into '
    tr "\`" "\'"
Then I deleted all the html tags
    sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
After that, I deleted every other line of hwords to remove the english words
    sed -n -e 'g;n;p'
After the file contains only hawaiian words, I remove spaces and commas and trea
t words separated by these characters as separate words.
    tr " " "\n"
    tr "," "\n"
After that, I removed the misspelled hawaiian words. Any word that contains a no
n-hawaiian letter is selected and deleted
    sed "/[^pkmnwlhaeiou\']/d"
I then sorted the dictionary
    sort -u

The resulting script for buildwords is:
#!/bin/bash
egrep '<td>.+<td>' $1 | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | tr "\`" "\'" | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | sed
 -n -e 'g;n;p' | tr " " "\n" | tr "," "\n" | sed "/[^pkmnwlhaeiou\']/d" | sort -
u | sed "1d"

I then modified the shell command to spell check against the hawaiin dictionary
instead
    cat assign.html | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | tr -cs "A-Za-z\'" "[\n*]" | sort -u | com
m -23 - hwords
I added in \' (because ' is a hawaiian letter as well), and also another tr comm
and to convert uppercase to lowercase (because the hawaiian dictionary only cona
ins lowercase words). This resulted in a total of 426 misspelled Hawaiian words,
 and 123 misspelled English words.

I used the following command to save the misspelled English and Hawaiian words i
nto files, then compare them
    cat lab2.html | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | tr -cs "A-Za-z" "[\n*]" | sort -u | comm -2
3 - words > misspelled_english
    cat lab2.html | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | tr -cs "A-Za-z\'" "[\n*]" | sort -u | comm
-23 - hwords > misspelled_hawaiian
Then I used the following command to find which words were misspelled in Hawaiia
n but not in English, or vice versa
    comm misspelled_english misspelled-hawaiian
The words in the 1st column are misspelled in only english, those in the 2nd col
umn are misspelled in only hawaiian. There are no words that are misspelled in E
nglish that are not also misspelled in Hawaiian ("doesn" is in the 1st column, b
ut also does not exist in the hawaiian dictionary). However, there are words tha
t are misspelled in Hawaiian that aren't misspelled in English, such as "work",
or "unique".
