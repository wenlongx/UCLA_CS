Lab ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, I booted my computer using the Ubuntu cd that my TA provided, by holding 
down F12 while booting the computer.

I then installed OpenSSH by typing the following into the command line:
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install openssh-client
After that, I created a public/private rsa key pair with the following command:
    ssh-keygen
I was prompted to choose the directory in which to save the key, and I chose 
the directory /home/ubuntu/.ssh/. I was then prompted to enter a passphrase, 
and confirm it. I saw the following output:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    05:f9:5d:15:50:f1:2e:53:ac:d1:3d:96:54:d3:a4:db ubuntu@ubuntu
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |        ..   .oOO|
    |        ..    o+*|
    |         ... .o+*|
    |         .. . .B.|
    |        S     = E|
    |               o |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +-----------------+
I then created a home directory for my parter, and created his account and an 
account password.
    mkdir /home/mike
    sudo useradd -d /home/mike -m mxiong
    sudo passwd mxiong
The last command prompted me for a password, and I entered one. I then created 
an .ssh directory for the new user:
    cd /home/mike
    sudo mkdir .ssh
And also changed ownership and permission on it as well:
    sudo chown -R mxiong .ssh
    sudo chmod 700 .ssh
This created the server on my computer. I used the following command:
    ifconfig
to get my IP address (10.97.85.164), which I gave to my partner.
    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 34:17:eb:bb:e0:90  
              inet addr:10.97.85.164  Bcast:10.97.85.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
              inet6 addr: fe80::3617:ebff:febb:e090/64 Scope:Link

              RX bytes:3290 (3.2 KB)  TX bytes:3290 (3.2 KB)
My partner then logged onto his computer, and ssh'ed into my machine. 
Afterwards, my partner repeated my steps to create a server on his machine. I 
then used the following commands to ssh onto his machine:
I first generated public/private keys:
    ssh-keygen
Which I wrote to the file /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa. I also entered a 
passphrase. This generated the following output:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    be:5d:c7:ca:b9:f0:5e:81:35:68:52:9d:62:20:25:0f ubuntu@ubuntu
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |        E.o... . |
    |         = .o.o  |
    |          o.o.o  |
    |           o o . |
    |        S   . .  |
    |       .     . . |
    |        . . . +  |
    |         o = =   |
    |        . ..B.   |
    +-----------------+
I then copied my public key to my partner's server for authentication:
    ssh-copy-id -i wx@10.97.85.186
In the last part of the command, wx is the username my partner created for me, 
and 10.97.85.186 is his IP address. I was then prompted for a password, which I 
entered. I then added my private key to the authentication agent with the 
following command:
    ssh-add
And ssh'ed into my partner's server with X11 session forwarding:
    ssh -X wx@10.97.85.186
I could then execute commands like:
    gedit
    xterm
And GUI windows would pop up. I exited the ssh session with the following 
command:
    exit

Homework ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I first logged onto my linux computer, then downloaded GPG and all it's 
dependencies:
    wget https://www.gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.0.29.tar.bz2
    wget https://www.gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgpg-error/libgpg-error-1.20.tar.bz2
    wget https://www.gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.4.tar.bz2
    wget https://www.gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.3.3.tar.bz2
    wget https://www.gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libassuan/libassuan-2.4.0.tar.bz2
Then I unzipped all the files:
    tar -xvf gnupg-2.0.29.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf libgpg-error-1.20.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf libksba-1.3.3.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf libassuan-2.4.0.tar.bz2
And installed them, dependencies first then gnupg:
    cd libgpg-error-1.20
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    cd ..
    cd libgcrypt-1.6.4
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    cd ..
    cd libksba-1.3.3
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    cd ..
    cd libassuan-2.4.0
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    cd ..
    cd gnupg-2.0.29
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
Afterwards, I used the command:
    gpg --gen-key
to generate my key pair. I used the default configuration, and entered my name 
and email when I was prompted to. I then generated entropy by performing other 
actions (moving my mouse, etc) during the generation. Then, I ran the following 
command to export my public key:
    gpg --armor --export wenlongx@gmail.com > hw-pubkey.asc
I then used the following command to create a tarball:
    tar -cvzf hw.tar.gz hw.txt hw-pubkey.asc log.txt
