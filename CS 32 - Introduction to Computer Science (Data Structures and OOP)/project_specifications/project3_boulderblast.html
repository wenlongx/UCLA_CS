<h2>Programming Assignment 3<br />
Boulder Blast</h2>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="spec.pdf">Project 3 specification document</a> is complete.
</p><p>
At 10 PM Monday 2/16, a paragraph was added on page 12 explaining what value
<em>StudentWorld::init()</em> must return.
</p><p>
To see what the game looks like in action:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On a Windows machine:  Open <a href="BoulderBlast-sample-windows.zip">the
sample executable zip file</a> and drag the folder named BoulderBlast in it
to your desktop.  In that desktop folder, double-click on the BoulderBlast
application.
<!--
The executable runs on the SEASnet Windows server; it may
not run on all Windows machines.  We're working on that.
-->
</li><li>
On a Mac:  Unzip <a href="BoulderBlast-sample-mac.zip">the sample executable
zip file</a>.  In that zip file is a file named README.txt that tells you
how to launch the program.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Use the arrow keys (or 8426 or wasd) to move or the space bar to shoot.
You can hit Escape to sacrifice a life and restart the current level.
You can type q to quit the game prematurely.  Hitting the f key
freezes the action; hitting any key after that takes one action step,
except that hitting the r key resumes regular play.  (This is not intended
for normal game play, but is useful for testing.)
</p><p>
You can also download the project skeletons with the code we've written,
for <a href="BoulderBlast-skeleton-windows.zip">Windows</a>,
<a href="BoulderBlast-skeleton-mac.zip">Mac</a>, or
<a href="linux.html">Linux</a>, and make sure you can build and run them. 
All they'll do is have you lose a life each time you hit Enter, but at
least you can verify that the graphics library works.
</p><p>
The <strong>only</strong> files you will modify are Actor.h, Actor.cpp,
StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp.  Indeed, those will be the only code
files you'll turn in, so in implementing your solution, you must
<strong>not</strong> depend on any changes you make to code files other than
those four.
</p><p>
At some point in Project 3, you may find the
<a href="../../stringstreams.html">Stringstreams</a> writeup helpful.
</p><p>
To make testing your program easier, you might want to slow down the game.
If you change the value of the constant MS_PER_FRAMES in GameController.cpp 
from 10 to a higher value, the game will run more slowly.
</p><p>
When testing your program, you may want to set up level files with easy-to-test
configurations.  The level files we provided are puzzles that make the game
interesting, but surely you don't want have to play a while before you reach
the situation you want to test!
