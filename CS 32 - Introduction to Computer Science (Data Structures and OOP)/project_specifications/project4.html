<p>
The <a href="spec.pdf">Project 4 specification document</a> is complete.
The <a href="skeleton.zip">skeleton code</a> contains the .cpp files you
must complete and, if you are not confident about the correctness of your
HashTable code, a file named substituteHashTable.h that you can rename to
HashTable.h (after safely saving a copy of the HashTable.h you're working
on) and use while working on other classes.
</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<dl>
<dt>3/12 11:30 PM</dt>
<dd>
Page 31 of the spec was updated to say that the project can be completed
in roughly 350 lines of C++ code beyond what we've already written for you.
</dd>
<dt>3/7 2:30 PM</dt>
<dd>
Visual Studio users who downloaded the skeleton zip file before 3/7 2:30 PM
found that substituteHashTable.h still failed to compile.  That's been
fixed.  Reload the skeleton zip file (make sure your browser is not just
giving you the old cached one) and extract substituteHashTable.h.
</dd>
<dt>3/7 9:30 AM</dt>
<dd>
Some people who downloaded the skeleton zip file before 3/7 2:00 AM reported
that substituteHashTable.h failed to compile.  That's been fixed.  Reload
the skeleton zip file (make sure your browser is not just giving you the
old cached one) and extract substituteHashTable.h.

Given our constraint of not using language features that would take too long
to explain, working around those darned arcane language rules are harder
than we thought.  Page 13 and page 16 have been modified to tell you to
implement the <em>computeHash()</em> functions in one of your .cpp files,
not in HashTable.h.
</dd>
<dt>3/5 11:30 AM</dt>
<dd>
On pp. 16-17, the description of how to use <em>computeHash()</em> was
modified to prevent confusing compilation errors on some compilers due to
arcane Standard C++ language rules.
