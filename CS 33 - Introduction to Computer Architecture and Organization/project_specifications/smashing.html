<h1>Smashing lab</h1>

<p>This assignment investigates an old-fashioned way of breaking into
  systems executing x86 machine code, along with a couple of machine-level
  defenses against this attack.  It's chosen not to give you a
  toolkit to break in to other sites &ndash; the method is well-known
  and ought to be commonly defended against nowadays &ndash; but
  instead, to give a general idea of how an attacker can break into a
  system by exploiting behavior that is undefined at the C level but
  defined at the machine level, and what we can do about it at the
  machine level.</p>

<h2>Keep a log</h2>

<p>Keep a log in the file <samp>smashinglab.txt</samp> of what you do
in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened. The log should help us verify that you've done the
  steps listed below, so that we can in principle reproduce them.
  For example, if one of the steps says "get a backtrace", make sure
the backtrace goes into the log.</p>

<h2>That's a nice little program you got there. Shame if anything were to happen to it</h2>

<p>Consider the following patch
to <a href='http://opensource.dyc.edu/sthttpd'>sthttpd</a>. This patch
  applies to <a href='sthttpd-2.27.0.tar.gz'>sthttpd 2.27.0</a>, and
  deliberately introduces a bug into it. The idea is to suppose the
  the original programmer wrote this version by mistake.</p>

<h2>Steps to illustrate and defend against the bug</h2>

<ol>

  <li>Make sure that <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp> is at the start of
  your PATH; the command <samp>which gcc</samp> should output
  "<samp>/usr/local/cs/bin/gcc</samp>".</li>

  <li>Build 32-bit sthttpd with this patch applied.
    Configure it with the shell command:

    <pre><samp>./configure \
   CFLAGS='-m32' \
   LDFLAGS="-Xlinker --rpath=/usr/local/cs/gcc-$(gcc -dumpversion)/lib"
</samp></pre>

    Compile it three times, with
    the following sets of compiler options:

    <dl>
      <dt>(SP) for strong stack protection:</dt>
      <dd><samp>-m32 -g3 -O2 -fno-inline -fstack-protector-strong</samp></dd>

      <dt>(AS) for address sanitization:</dt>
      <dd><samp>-m32 -g3 -O2 -fno-inline -fsanitize=address</samp></dd>

      <dt>(NO) for neither:</dt>
      <dd><samp>-m32 -g3 -O2 -fno-inline</samp></dd>
    </dl>

    Call the resulting
    executables <samp>src/thttpd-sp</samp>, <samp>src/thttpd-as</samp>,
    and <samp>src/thttpd-no</samp>.  You can do this with, for example,
    the command <samp>make clean</samp> followed by <samp>make
    CFLAGS='-m32 -g3 -O2 -fno-inline -fstack-protector-strong'</samp> and
   then by <samp>mv src/thttpd src/thttpd-sp</samp> and similarly for
    the other two variants.
  </li>

  <li>Run each of the modified sthttpd daemons on port (12330 + 3 * (X
% 293) + Y) on one of the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers, where X is your
9-digit student ID and Y is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on which
variant of the daemon you're running (1=SP, 2=AS, 3=NO). For example,
if your student ID is 123-456-789, (12330 + 3 * (123456789 % 293) + 1)
equals 12532, so you can run the command <samp>src/thttpd-sp -p 12532
-D</samp>; the <samp>-p</samp> option specifies the port number and
the <samp>-D</samp> is for debugging. You may find
the <a href='http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/thttpd_man.html'>thttpd
man page</a> useful.</li>

  <li>Verify that your web servers work in the normal case.
    You can use the <samp>curl</samp> command to do this, e.g.,
  the shell command <samp>curl http://localhost:12532/foo.txt</samp>
  where <samp>foo.txt</samp> is a text file in the working directory
  of your HTTPD server. The shell command <samp>man curl</samp> will
  give you more information about <samp>curl</samp>.</li>

<li>Make variant SP crash by invoking it in a suitable way.
Run it under GDB, and get a backtrace immediately after
the crash. Identify which machine instruction caused the crash, and why.</li>

  <li>Make variant AS crash by invoking it in a similar way.
    Similarly, get a backtrace for it, and identify the machine
    instruction that crashed it and wy.</li>

  <li>Likewise for variant NO.</li>

<li>Generate the assembly language
  code for <samp>thttpd.c</samp> three times, one for each variant,
  by using <samp>gcc -S</samp> rather than <samp>gcc -c -g3</samp>
  when compiling the file. (Use the same <samp>-O</samp> and <samp>-f</samp>
  flags as before.)
Call the resulting
files <samp>src/thttpd-sp.s</samp>
  and <samp>src/thttpd-as.s</samp>
  and <samp>src/thttpd-no.s</samp>. Compare the three
  assembly-language files' implementations of the <samp>handle_read</samp>
  function. Describe the techniques used
  by <samp>-fstack-protector-strong</samp>
  and <samp>-fsanitize=address</samp> to prevent buffer-overrun
  exploits in <samp>handle_read</samp>.</li>

  <li>Build an exploit for the bug in variant NO that relies on
    the attacker tricking the victim into invoking <samp>thttpd</samp>
    with a particular value for the <samp>-C</samp> option.
    (Admittedly this is not
    much of an exploit, but we don't want you to have to put more easily
    exploitable HTTP servers on our network.) Your
exploit should cause the victim web server to remove the
file <samp>target.txt</samp> in the working directory of the web server.

 Or, if such an exploit is impossible, explain why not, and
    investigate simple ways to alter the compiler flags (or, in the
    worst case, to insert plausible bugs into the source code) to make
    the exploit possible.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the files <samp>smashinglab.txt</samp>, <samp>thttpd-sp.s</samp>,
  <samp>thttpd-as.s</samp>, and <samp>thttpd-no.s</samp>
  as described above, along with any other files needed to explain
your exploit.</p>

<p>All text files should be ASCII files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 200 columns per line.
For example, the shell
command</p>

<pre><samp>expand smashinglab.txt thttpd-sp.s thttpd-as.s thttpd-no.s |
  awk '/\r/ || 200 &lt; length'
</samp></pre>

<p>should output nothing.</p>
