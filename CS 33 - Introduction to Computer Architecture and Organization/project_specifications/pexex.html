<h1>Program Execution Explorer lab</h1>

<h2>Useful pointers</h2>

<ul>
 <li><a href='https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/'>Debugging with GDB</a> (2015)</li>
 <li><a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Arithmetic-Operations.html'>Arithmetic operations</a> in the GNU Elisp manual (2015) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The name of this assignment comes from the idea that a debugger
like GDB is better thought of as a way of exploring program execution
histories than merely as a debugger.</p>

<p>Although the GNU Emacs text editor is not intended for high
  performance numeric computation, its scripting
  language <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html'>Elisp</a>
  is reasonably widely used and Elisp applications needs adequate (if
  not stellar) performance for numeric applications.  One such
  application, <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/calc/index.html'>GNU
  Calc</a>, is a desk calculator that does a lot of arithmetic
  internally. Your goal is to see how much overhead is imposed by
  Emacs when doing standard arithmetic operations, in particular
  multiplication with two integer arguments, and to think about how
  to reduce the arithmetic overhead.</p>

<h2>Keep a log</h2>

<p>Keep a log in the file <samp>pexexlab.txt</samp> of what you do in
the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should not
merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a lab
notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and what
happened. It should record not just what worked, but also
what <em>didn't</em> work.</p>

<h2>Gather instruction traces</h2>

<p>You can multiply two numbers with Emacs from the shell by running a
  command like this:

  <pre><samp>  emacs -batch -eval '(print (* 37 -26))'</samp></pre>

<p>Gather a trace for the key part of the above test case.  This trace
should include every instruction in the <samp>Ftimes</samp> function,
which is the C implementation of the Elisp <samp>*</samp> function.
It should also include every instruction in every function
  that <samp>Ftimes</samp> calls, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this assignment, a trace is an ASCII text file.
  Each line corresponds to a single machine instruction executed in turn
  during the trace. Lines use the following format:</p>

  <pre><samp>0x8120921&lt;arith_driver+1&gt;data.c:2577	push %edi	M[0xffffc9c4]=0x084073c2 esp=0xffffc9c4</samp></pre>

<p>Columns should be separated by single tab characters.  The first
  column gives the machine address of the instruction, both in
  hexadecimal and (in angle brackets) as an offset from the current
  function); this address is followed by
  the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename'>basename</a> of
  the source file and line number that is most responsible for the
  instruction; the example source line is
  the <samp>{</samp> at the start of the <samp>arith_driver</samp> procedure,
  since the instruction is part of that
  function's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue'>prolog</a>.
  The second column gives the machine instruction in the same format
  used by GDB's <samp>x/i</samp> command, using a space to separate the
  instruction from operands.  The third column gives the effect of the
  instruction on memory and general-purpose registers, again using
  hexadecimal values. The example above stores 0x084073c2 into the
  memory word at address 0xffffc9c4; the leading 0 in "084073c2" reminds
  the reader that it's a 32-bit operation.  The example also sets
  the <samp>esp</samp> register to 0xffffc9c4.  List memory
  modifications in increasing address order, and register
  modifications in alphabetical order. Traces need not record
  modifications to status registers such as <samp>eflags</samp>.</p>

<p>To gather information for your first trace
(which you should put into the file <samp>trace1.tr</samp>),
use the executable <samp>~eggert/bin32/bin/emacs-24.5</samp> on the
SEASnet GNU/Linux servers. The corresponding source code can be found in
<samp>~eggert/src/emacs-24.5/</samp> (particularly
its <samp>src</samp> subdirctory), and the executable was compiled for
the x86. The above example trace line corresponds to line 2577
of <samp>~eggert/src/emacs-24.5/src/data.c</samp>.</p>

<p>Gather a second trace <samp>trace2.tr</samp> for the same test case
from the executable
<samp>~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5</samp> on the same platform. It is
generated from the same source code, and was compiled for the
x86-64.</p>

<p>Gather a third trace <samp>trace3.tr</samp> from a test case
    that prints <samp>(* most-positive-fixnum most-positive-fixnum)</samp>
    instead.  Use the x86 Emacs for this test case; on this platform,
    <samp>most-positive-fixnum</samp> is 536870911.</p>

<h2>Examine integer overflow handling</h2>

<p>Compile the following function:</p>
<pre><samp>  #include &lt;limits.h&gt;
  int big = INT_MAX;
  int
  testovf (void)
  {
    return big + 1 < big;
  }
</samp></pre>
<p>for the x86 in three ways: (1) with <samp>-O2</samp>, (2)
with <samp>-O2 -ftrapv</samp>, (3) with <samp>-O2
-fwrapv</samp>. Compare the resulting assembly-language files, and
describe and justify the differences that you see. Put your
description into a plain ASCII text file <samp>testovf.txt</samp>.</p>

<h2>A few more questions</h2>

<p>Answer the following questions, in a plain text file <samp>answers.txt</samp>:</p>

<ol>
<li> Explain why the instructions in the third trace did not produce the correct mathematical result. Which instructions caused the problem, exactly?</li>

<li> If you just count instructions, which trace is the most efficient and why?</li>

<li> Similarly, which is the least efficient and why?</li>

<li> Where did the number 536870911 come from? Explain in terms of the
Emacs source code.</li>

<li> The two Emacs executables were compiled with GCC's <samp>-O2</samp> option.
  Suppose they had also been compiled with <samp>-ftrapv</samp>.
  Explain any problems the traces would run into, or if there would
  not be a problem explain why not.</li>

<li> Similarly, discuss whether and how <samp>-fwrapv</samp> would have caused
  problems. </li>

<li> Suppose we assume <samp>-fwrapv</samp> is used. Suggest changes
  to how Emacs does integer multiplication that should help improve
  its performance. Focus on just the integer multiplication; don't
  alter the machinery Emacs uses to decide which flavor of
  multiplication to do.</li>

<li> How significant are the efficiency differences discussed above,
  in the context of Emacs execution? </li>
</ol>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a compressed tarball <samp>pexex.tgz</samp> containing the
files mentioned above, namely
<samp>pexexlab.txt</samp>, <samp>trace1.tr</samp>, <samp>trace2.tr</samp>, <samp>trace3.tr</samp>, <samp>testovf.txt</samp>,
and <samp>answers.txt</samp>.</p>
