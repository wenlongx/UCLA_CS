	Machine Level Representation of Data (objects in memory)
	Assembly Level Machine Organization (assembly language)
	Interfacint and Communication
	Functional Organization 
	Multiprocessing and Alternative Architectures (threading/multiprocessors)
	Performance Enhancements (making programs faster)
	Memory Management
	Parallelism (intro, not cover the entire thing)

	Goals:	Write better software
				avoid bugs
				find and fix bugs more efficiently
                performance bugs are bugs
            Understand computer systems
                compiler
                operating systems
                computer architecture
                parallel programming

    #define ADD(a,b) ((a)+(b))
    int sum(int a, int b){
        return ADD((a)+(b));
    }
    becomes:
    int sum(int a, int b){
        return ((a)+(b));
    }
    
    gcc -E add.c
    gcc -o2 -c sum.i
    READ UP ON GCC COMPILER COMMANDS LATER

Binary Representation
    Simpler than base 10
    Cheaper per bit
    Denser representation?

Bitwise Operators vs Boolean Operations
    bitwise gives you n bits, while boolean gives you only 1 bit
    bitwise operators (a|b, a&b, a^b, ~a)
    boolean operators (!a, a==b, a&&b, a||b, a<b, a>b, a<=b, a>=b)

bitvectors represent sets of small integers
s&t     set intersection
s|t     set

Usually between 8 and 120 registers
Registers are usually 32 or 64 bit (x86 is 32 bit, and x8664 is 64 bit)
    Registers are used to compute addresses
    What is the advantage of 32 bit?
        faster per operation - faster to add or subtract or operate on things
    What is the advantage of 64 bit?
        can hold longer addresses (more locations)/more memory
